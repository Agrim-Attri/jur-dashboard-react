# Jur Dashboard React Implementation

This project is a React implementation of a dashboard design provided as part of a coding assignment. It focuses on replicating the layout, basic functionality, and responsiveness of the original design.

## Approach

*   **Frontend Framework:** React.js (created with Create React App)
*   **Styling:** CSS (styles.css)
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The dashboard is built using modular components for reusability and maintainability.
*   **Responsiveness:** Media queries are used to ensure the dashboard adapts to various screen sizes.
*   **Basic Functionality:** Includes form validation (required fields), dynamic progress bar updates on button click.

## Challenges and Solutions

*   **(Example Challenge):** Initially, I had trouble getting the progress bar to render correctly. I realized I was missing an import statement.
*   **(Example Solution):** Added the necessary import statement for the ProgressBar component in App.js.
*   **(Another Example Challenge)**: Getting the styling to precisely match the reference image using only CSS required careful attention to detail and some experimentation.
*   **(Another Example Solution)**: Used flexbox for layout and precise pixel measurements for elements like the progress bar circles and lines.

## Assumptions

*   For this exercise, I focused primarily on replicating the front-end design and basic interactions. Full backend integration and more advanced features (like actual file uploads) were not implemented.
*   Inline styles were initially used for rapid prototyping in CodeSandbox, then migrated to an external CSS file for better organization.

## Screenshots

*(Here, you would include screenshots of your dashboard in desktop, tablet, and mobile views. You can take screenshots in CodeSandbox or after running the project locally.)*
